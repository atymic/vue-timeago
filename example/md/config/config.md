By default `vue-timeago` will use the `en` locale.

Any other locales you require must be loaded from `date-fns`.  
You can view the available locales in the `date-fns` docs:  
[https://date-fns.org/docs/I18n](https://date-fns.org/docs/I18n)

You can also change the Component name if required by setting the `name` option.

Please see the library readme for all options:
